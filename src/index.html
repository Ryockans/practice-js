      We're no strangers to love<br>
      You know the rules and so do I<br>
      A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>

      Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it<br>
      Inside, we both know what's been going on<br>
      We know the game, and we're gonna play it<br>
      <br>
      And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
      Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br>
